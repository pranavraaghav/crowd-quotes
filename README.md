# Crowd Quotes 
A random quotes API where all the quotes are provided by users and reviewed by other users. 

<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
Have you ever come up with a great quote and went "Huh, maybe I should share this with the rest of the world" only to then go on and post it on your twitter where you get 5 views and 1 like? Or maybe wanted to source random quotes from the internet authored by real people based off of real life experiences? 

In Crowd Quotes, anybody can submit their unique quote(s) which can then be provided to other end users who query the public API seeking random quotes.
